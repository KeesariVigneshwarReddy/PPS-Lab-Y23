# Programming for Problem Solving Lab
#### Solutions to Lab assignments

Welcome to the Programming for Problem Solving Lab Assignments repository! ðŸš€ Here, you'll find solutions to Lab assignments.

## Disclaimer

**Please Note**: The purpose of this repository is to serve as a resource for learning and understanding coding techniques, algorithms, and problem-solving approaches. It is **not** intended for direct copy-pasting of code when you are in your lab.

We strongly encourage you to use these solutions as a reference, to gain insights into different problem-solving methods. Attempt the assignments on your own first, and leverage these solutions to guide your thinking and improve your skills.

## Folder Structure

Each lab assignment has its own dedicated folder, containing solutions to questions. Feel free to explore and adapt the code to your understanding, but remember the importance of learning through active engagement.

## Tips
Hey there, I am your senior who has already studied the PPS course which you are studying. I am giving these tips solely on the basis of my experience.
1. This course (Theory + Lab) is most important in your first semester. It builds the foundations to courses that you study in years ahead.
2. Attend all the classes regularly and do not miss any lab.
3. Try to learn concepts rather than just cramming it.
4. Be open-minded to explore other approaches to a problem statement.
5. Have a healthy competition with your friends.
